# Contributing to DCLM Radio

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to DCLM Radio!

There are many ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

## Asking Questions

If you have a question, you can ask on the [discussions page](https://github.com/dclmict/dclm-radio.app/discussions/categories/q-a).

## Providing Feedback

Your comments and feedback are welcome.

## Reporting Issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem in DCLM Radio? Have a feature request? We want to hear about it! Here's how you can report your issue as effectively as possible.

### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/dclmict/dclm-radio.app/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

- üëç - upvote
- üëé - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

Please include the following with each issue:

- Version of DCLM Radio

- Your operating system and version

- Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) that cause the issue

- What you expected to see, versus what you actually saw

- Images, animations, or a link to a video showing the issue occurring

- A code snippet that demonstrates the issue or a link to a code repository the developers can easily pull down to recreate the issue locally

  - **Note:** Because the developers need to copy and paste the code snippet, including a code snippet as a media file (i.e. .gif) is not sufficient.

- Errors/Screenshots from the DevTools Console.

### Creating Pull Requests

In order to quickly review and accept your pull requests, always create one pull request per issue and link the issue in the pull request. Make sure to follow standard coding principles and keep code changes as small as possible. Avoid pure formatting changes to code that has not been modified otherwise. Pull requests should contain tests whenever possible. Pull requests only fixing spell check errors in source code are not recommended.

### Follow Your Issue

Be sure to understand what will happen next, so you know what to expect, and how to continue to assist throughout the process.
